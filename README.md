# Shop Shop Redux
![MIT License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT_License-green)

## Description
[Shop Shop Redux](https://shopp-shopp.herokuapp.com/) is a refactor of my other Shop Shop repository from React Context to Redux. This allows the app to have a gloabl state preventing the need to prop drill from one component to the next allowing this app to scale to a much larger app with ease. Shop Shop is a simple e-commerce website, allowing users to view a variety of products and their respective categories, add them to their cart, and checkout with stripe (currently in sandbox).
